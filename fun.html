            <p>Cutthroat Kitchen is one of my favorite cooking show, the reason I like this show is because its not really a cooking show. 
            Its a cooking game where everyone gets 25,000 dollars, you bid for challenges for other contestants to try to make them lose. 
            If you win, whatever money you have left is for you to keep.</p>
